# SIR-Model

The SIR model is a simple mathematical model of epidemics. An epidemic is when the number of people infected with a disease is increasing in a population.

S, I, and R stand for:

S - susceptible. These are people that are not infected with the disease yet. However, they are not immune to it either, and so they can become infected with the disease in the future.

I - infected or infectious. These are people that are infected with the disease and can transmit the disease to susceptible people.

R - recovered. These are people who have recovered from the disease and are immune, so they can no longer be infected with the disease.
